# 首次覆盖（Initiating Coverage）

> 分类：权益研究 | 技能 id：`initiating-coverage`

## 引导词（首轮必读）

当用户触发本技能但尚未提供必要输入（如股票代码、财报期、行业名称、财务数据或文件等）时，**第一轮输出必须先给出引导语**，格式为：

```
已选择 **首次覆盖** 技能

请提供您要分析的标的信息（如股票代码、行业名称、财务数据或相关文件），我将为您首次覆盖深度报告，包含公司研究、财务建模、估值分析、目标价和投资评级。
```

然后等待用户提供信息，再开始正式分析。若用户消息已包含足够信息，则直接开始分析，跳过引导环节。

## 能力定位

Create institutional-quality equity research initiation reports through a structured 5-task workflow. Each task must be executed separately with verified inputs.

### Overview

This skill produces comprehensive first-time coverage reports following institutional standards (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley format). Tasks are executed individually, each verifying prerequisites before proceeding.

**Default Font**: Times New Roman throughout all documents (unless user specifies otherwise).

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: One Task at a Time

**THIS SKILL OPERATES IN SINGLE-TASK MODE ONLY.**

#### If User Requests Full Pipeline

When user requests:
- "Create a coverage initiation report for [Company]"
- "Write an initiation report for [Company]"
- "Do the entire equity research process for [Company]"
- "Complete all 5 tasks for [Company]"
- Any request that implies running multiple tasks or the entire workflow

**REQUIRED RESPONSE:**

1. **Ask which specific task to perform:**
   ```
   I can help you create an equity research initiation report for [Company].
   This involves 5 separate tasks that need to be completed individually:

   1. Company Research - Research business, management, industry
   2. Financial Modeling - Build projection model
   3. Valuation Analysis - DCF and comparable companies
   4. Chart Generation - Create 25-35 charts
   5. Report Assembly - Compile final report

   Which task would you like to start with?
   ```

2. **When user explicitly requests all tasks together:**
   ```
   I understand you'd like to complete the entire initiation report pipeline.
   Currently, this skill supports executing one task at a time, which allows
   for better quality control and review at each stage.

   We're working on a seamless end-to-end workflow that will make this process
   more automated, but for now, we'll need to complete each task separately.

   Would you like to start with Task 1 (Company Research)?
   ```

3. **Never automatically assume which task to start** - always ask user to confirm.

4. **Never execute multiple tasks in sequence** - complete one task, deliver outputs, then wait for next user request.

#### Task Execution Rules

- ✅ Execute exactly ONE task per user request
- ✅ Always verify prerequisites before starting a task
- ✅ Deliver task outputs and confirm completion
- ✅ Wait for user to explicitly request the next task
- ❌ Never chain multiple tasks together automatically
- ❌ Never assume user wants to proceed to next task
- ❌ Never execute Tasks 3-5 without verifying required inputs exist

#### ⚠️ Deliverables Policy: NO SHORTCUTS

**DELIVER ONLY THE SPECIFIED OUTPUTS. DO NOT CREATE EXTRA DOCUMENTS.**

Each task specifies exact deliverables. Do NOT create:
- ❌ "Completion summaries"
- ❌ "Executive summaries"
- ❌ "Quick reference guides"
- ❌ "Next steps documents"
- ❌ "Task completion reports"
- ❌ Any other "helpful" documentation not explicitly specified

**Why**: These extras waste context and are not part of the professional workflow.

**What TO deliver**:
- ✅ Task 1: Research document (.md) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 2: Financial model (.xlsx) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 3: Valuation analysis (.md) + Excel tabs added to Task 2 file — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 4: Charts zip file (.zip) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 5: Final report (.docx) — **NOTHING ELSE**

**If a deliverable is not listed above, DO NOT CREATE IT.**

---

### Task Selection

Select which task to execute:

| Task | Name | Prerequisites | Output |
|------|------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | Company Research | Company name/ticker | 6-8K word document |
| **2** | Financial Modeling | 10-K or financials access | Excel model (6 tabs) |
| **3** | Valuation Analysis | Financial model (Task 2) | Valuation + price target |
| **4** | Chart Generation | Tasks 1, 2, 3 + external data | 25-35 PNG/JPG charts |
| **5** | Report Assembly | ALL previous tasks (1-4) | 30-50 page DOCX report |

---

### How to Use This Skill

#### User Request Patterns and Responses

**Pattern 1: User specifies a specific task**
```
User: "Use initiating-coverage, Task 1 for Tesla"
Response: ✅ Execute Task 1 immediately
```

**Pattern 2: User asks for "initiation report" or "full pipeline"**
```
User: "Create a coverage initiation report for Tesla"
Response: ❌ DO NOT start any task automatically
         ✅ Ask which task to start with (see template above)
```

**Pattern 3: User wants to do "all tasks" or "entire workflow"**
```
User: "I want to complete all 5 tasks for Tesla"
Response: ❌ DO NOT chain tasks together
         ✅ Explain one-at-a-time limitation (see template above)
         ✅ Ask if they want to start with Task 1
```

#### Correct Usage Examples

**Executing a single task:**
```
"Use initiating-coverage skill, Task 1 for Tesla"
"Do Task 2 of initiating-coverage for Tesla"
"Run Task 3 for Tesla using the initiating-coverage skill"
```

**Completing full report (requires 5 separate requests):**
```
Request 1: "Do Task 1 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 2: "Do Task 2 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 3: "Do Task 3 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 4: "Do Task 4 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 5: "Do Task 5 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
```

#### Task Execution Order

For a complete initiation report, tasks must be executed in separate user requests following this order:

```
Request 1: Task 1 - Company Research (independent)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 2: Task 2 - Financial Modeling (independent)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 3: Task 3 - Valuation Analysis (requires Task 2 output)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 4: Task 4 - Chart Generation (requires Tasks 2 & 3 outputs)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 5: Task 5 - Report Assembly (requires ALL previous task outputs)
```

**Note**: Tasks 1 and 2 can be run in any order. Tasks 3-5 have strict dependencies and must verify inputs before proceeding.

```

**Process**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Verify ALL prerequisites before starting
2. Load detailed instructions from references/task5-report-assembly.md
3. Execute report assembly workflow using Claude's built-in skills:
   - **Use DOCX skill** to create and manipulate the Word document
   - **Use XLSX skill** to read Excel data from Task 2/3
   - **Use Read tool** to read Task 1 and Task 3 markdown files
   - Read Task 1 .md file → Convert to Word formatting → Insert charts inline
   - Read Task 2 .xlsx file → Extract tables → Write quantitative analysis
   - Read Task 3 .md file + Excel tabs → Copy/adapt valuation analysis
   - Insert Task 4 .png chart files throughout using DOCX skill
   - Create text-dense report with charts interspersed every 200-300 words
4. Save and deliver final DOCX report

**Key Principles**:
- Use Claude's DOCX and XLSX skills (NOT Python libraries)
- Use actual file operations (read .md/.xlsx/.png files, write .docx file)
- Good equity research reports are text-dense with lots of illustrating images (60-80% page coverage, 1+ chart per page)

**🔥 CRITICAL: GO ALL OUT ON THIS TASK**

**THIS IS THE FINAL DELIVERABLE. DO NOT TAKE SHORTCUTS.**

- ✅ **Use full token budget** - This is the culmination of all previous work

### Input Verification Protocol

#### Why Input Verification Matters

Each task has strict prerequisites. Running a task without required inputs will:
- Waste time with incomplete work
- Produce low-quality outputs
- Require rework

**Always verify inputs before starting a task.**

#### Verification Checklist by Task

**Task 1**: ✅ No verification needed (independent)

**Task 2**: Check historical financials available

**Task 3**: Check financial model exists and is accessible

**Task 4**: Check both model (Task 2) AND valuation (Task 3) exist

**Task 5**: Check ALL previous tasks complete (1, 2, 3, 4)

#### What to Do if Verification Fails

```
IF prerequisites are missing:
1. Stop the current task
2. Identify which prerequisite task(s) need to be completed
3. Execute the missing task(s) first
4. Return to current task once prerequisites are met
```

#### Example Verification Dialogue

```
User: "Use initiating-coverage, Task 5 for Tesla"

Claude: "Starting Task 5: Report Assembly for Tesla

VERIFICATION - Checking prerequisites:
- Task 1 (Company research)... ❌ NOT FOUND
- Task 2 (Financial model)... ❌ NOT FOUND
- Task 3 (Valuation)... ❌ NOT FOUND
- Task 4 (Charts)... ❌ NOT FOUND

⚠️ VERIFICATION FAILED

Task 5 requires ALL previous tasks to be complete.

To proceed:
1. Complete Task 1: Company Research
2. Complete Task 2: Financial Modeling
3. Complete Task 3: Valuation Analysis
4. Complete Task 4: Chart Generation
5. Then return to Task 5

Would you like to start with Task 1 first?"
```

### Task Reference Files

Detailed instructions for each task are in separate reference files to keep this skill lean:

- **references/task1-company-research.md** - Company research workflow
- **references/task2-financial-modeling.md** - Financial modeling workflow
- **references/task3-valuation.md** - Valuation methodology
  - Also see: references/valuation-methodologies.md for DCF/comps deep dive
- **references/task4-chart-generation.md** - Chart generation workflow
- **references/task5-report-assembly.md** - Report writing workflow
  - Also see: assets/report-template.md for report structure
  - Also see: assets/quality-checklist.md for quality checks

**When to load reference files**: Load ONLY the reference file associated with the specific task being performed. These files are very large - do not load multiple reference files at once. Read the appropriate task reference file at the start of the task for detailed step-by-step instructions.

---

### Quality Standards

All outputs meet institutional standards from leading investment banks (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley):

- **Comprehensive**: Meet all minimum requirements
- **Detailed**: Specific data and examples, not generic statements
- **Quantified**: Lead with numbers and metrics
- **Cited**: Proper sources with clickable hyperlinks
- **Professional**: Institutional-quality formatting
- **Accurate**: All numbers verified and cross-checked

---

### Important Notes

#### Task Independence

- **Task 1** can run anytime (no dependencies)
- **Task 2** can run anytime (just needs historical data)
- **Tasks 1 & 2** can run in parallel
- **Task 3** requires Task 2
- **Task 4** requires Tasks 2 & 3
- **Task 5** requires Tasks 1, 2, 3, & 4

#### Session Management

**Same session**: Outputs automatically available to subsequent tasks

**Different sessions**: Reference previous task outputs explicitly
```
"Use Task 3 with the model from yesterday at [path]"
"Use Task 5 with the research document at [path]"
```

#### File Organization

Recommended structure during workflow:
```
ProjectFolder/
├── Task1_Research/
│   └── [Company]_Research_Document.md
├── Task2_Model/
│   └── [Company]_Financial_Model.xlsx
├── Task3_Valuation/
│   └── [Company]_Valuation_Analysis.pdf
├── Task4_Charts/
│   ├── chart_01.png
│   └── ... (25-35 files)
└── Task5_Report/
    └── [Company]_Initiation_Report.docx
```

#### No End-to-End Execution

This skill does **NOT** support running all tasks automatically in sequence. Each task must be explicitly requested and verified.

**Why**: This ensures:
- Quality control at each stage
- Ability to review outputs before proceeding
- Flexibility to pause/resume workflow
- Clear verification of prerequisites

---

### Success Criteria

A successful initiation report workflow should:
1. Complete all 5 tasks in order
2. Pass all input verifications
3. Meet all quality standards
4. Produce all required deliverables
5. Numbers cross-check between outputs
6. Final report is publication-ready

**Output quality**: Institutional (JPMorgan/Goldman/Morgan Stanley level)
**Use case**: First-time comprehensive coverage of a company

## 数据获取规范

- 涉及行情/财报/估值/新闻等数据时，**优先调用 dsh-finance-tools 提供的金融数据工具**：
  - `search_stock`（代码/名称搜索）、`get_stock_quote`（实时行情，A股五源轮换+美股）
  - `get_financial_report`（利润表/资产负债表/现金流/核心指标）、`get_stock_news`（个股新闻）
  - `get_company_announcements`（公告）、`get_research_reports`（研报）、`get_analyst_estimates`（分析师预期）
  - `get_market_sentiment` / `get_sector_fund_flow` / `get_hot_stock_rank` / `get_dragon_tiger` / `get_northbound_flow` / `get_limit_up_pool` / `get_kline` / `get_stock_fund_flow` / `get_industry_overview` / `get_earnings_alerts` / `get_company_profile` / `get_company_info` / `get_top_shareholders`
- **禁止编造数字**：结构化数据必须来自上述工具；无法获取时标注"数据暂缺"或"假设"，并说明理由。
- `web_search`（豆包搜索）仅用于新闻、政策面、舆情等工具无法覆盖的信息，并注明来源。

## 输出要求

- 使用中文，金融术语可保留英文缩写；关键结论加粗；多用表格呈现对比数据。
- 客观数据注明来源；无法获取的一律标注"假设"并给出取值理由。
- 投资类结论必须附风险提示："以上为AI生成内容，不构成投资建议，市场有风险，投资须谨慎。"

## 交付件格式

分析结论必须产出**一份 HTML 文件**，不要产出 Markdown 文件：

- **文件名**：`{分析主题}_{标的代码或名称}_{YYYYMMDD}.html`（例 `DCF估值模型_长鑫科技_688825_20261008.html`）
- 保存后，回答正文只给 3–5 行要点摘要 + 文件名，**不要**把 HTML 全文贴进回答

硬性要求：

0. **本节优先级最高**：若上文（技能说明、能力定位、输出格式等）出现「使用 Markdown 表格」「Markdown 格式」「.md 文件」等表述，一律以本节为准 —— 最终产物是 `.html` 文件，所谓「表格」即在 HTML 内用 `<table class="t">` 呈现，**不得**产出 `.md`。
1. **单文件零依赖**：样式全部写在 `<style>` 内联；不引外链 CSS/JS、不用 CDN、不写 `<script>`。
2. **照抄骨架、只填空**：把下方骨架中 `<!-- 填 … -->` 替换为实际内容；`<style>` 与标签结构不得改动、不得增删标签。
3. 表格一律 `<table class="t">`（外层套 `<div class="tw">` 以便窄屏横向滚动）；数值单元格加 `class="n"` 右对齐；涨用 `<span class="up">`（红）、跌用 `<span class="dn">`（绿）。
4. 核心结论放 `<div class="key">`；关键数字放 `.kpis` 里的 `.kpi` 卡（每卡一个 `.k` 标签 + 一个 `.v` 数值）。
5. 需要横向对比时用纯 CSS `.bars` 条形图（下方骨架已含样式），**不要**手写 `<svg>`（易画坏）。
6. 正文**不得出现**：`.md` 文件路径、`$$` 或 `\frac` 等 LaTeX 残留、"报告已生成"之类过程说明。
